For years, **create-react-app (CRA)** was the go-to tool for bootstrapping new React projects. It provided an easy way for developers to start a React application with zero configuration, making it highly popular among beginners and professionals alike. However, in recent years, CRA has seen a decline in usage, with modern tools like **Vite, Next.js, and Remix** taking over the React ecosystem. In this blog, weâ€™ll explore why CRA fell out of favor, the challenges that led to its decline, and what developers should use instead.

---

## 1. The Rise of Create-React-App

When React was first introduced, setting up a project was a manual and tedious process. Developers had to configure **Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other tools** manually before they could even start coding. To solve this, **Facebook introduced create-react-app in 2016**, providing a simple way to scaffold a new React project with sensible defaults.

### **Why CRA Became Popular**

- **Zero Configuration:** No need to configure Webpack, Babel, or ESLint manually.
- **Easy to Use:** A single command (`npx create-react-app my-app`) created a working React project.
- **Maintained by Facebook:** Being an official tool from the React team, it gained widespread trust.
- **Strong Community Support:** A large number of tutorials, guides, and community discussions were based on CRA.

At its peak, CRA was used in thousands of projects and considered the default way to start a React app. However, as web development evolved, its limitations started to show.

## 2. The Problems with Create-React-App

Over time, developers started experiencing several issues with CRA that made it less appealing for modern web development. Here are some of the main problems:

### **1. Performance Issues**

CRA uses Webpack under the hood, which, while powerful, is not the fastest bundler. As React applications grew, developers found that:

- **Slow startup times** during development
- **Long build times** for production
- **Large bundle sizes** that affected performance

#### **Comparison: CRA vs Vite (Development Startup Time)**

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Tool</th>
    <th>Cold Start Time</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CRA</td>
    <td>~5-10 seconds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vite</td>
    <td>&lt; 1 second</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Vite, which leverages **ES Modules and Rollup**, dramatically improves development speed compared to CRAâ€™s Webpack-based build system.

### **2. Lack of Flexibility**

One of the biggest pain points of CRA is its **rigid configuration**. While it abstracts away complex Webpack configurations, it does so at the cost of flexibility. The only way to customize Webpack in CRA is by **ejecting**, which:

- Exposes thousands of lines of configuration code
- Makes it hard to maintain updates
- Cannot be reversed easily

Other modern tools like Vite and Next.js offer built-in flexibility **without needing to eject**.

### **3. Slow Updates and Maintenance Issues**

Despite being an official React tool, CRA suffered from **slow updates**. Webpack, Babel, and React itself moved forward, but CRA often lagged behind in adopting newer versions.

For example, when **React 18** was released, CRA took a long time to provide official support. This led many developers to abandon it in favor of faster-updating tools.

### **4. No Built-in Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG)**

Modern React applications increasingly rely on **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)** to improve performance and SEO. However, CRA only supports client-side rendering (CSR), which:

- Can lead to slower initial page loads
- Is less SEO-friendly compared to SSR/SSG frameworks

Tools like **Next.js** and **Remix** provide SSR and SSG out of the box, making them better choices for modern web applications.

### **5. Better Alternatives Emerged**

As developers sought better performance, flexibility, and features, several tools started gaining popularity:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Alternative</th>
    <th>Key Features</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Vite**</td>
    <td>Super-fast development server, optimized bundling</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Next.js**</td>
    <td>SSR, SSG, API routes, optimized image handling</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Remix**</td>
    <td>Focus on web standards, better routing, SSR</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These tools offer significant advantages over CRA, making them the preferred choices for new projects.

## 3. The Shift Towards Modern Build Tools

### **1. Vite: The New Standard for React Development**

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) has quickly become the most recommended tool for creating React projects. Unlike CRA, Vite:

- Uses **ES Modules** instead of bundling during development, leading to near-instant startup times.
- Provides **better tree-shaking and optimized builds** using Rollup.
- Supports **custom configuration** without the need to eject.

#### **Migrating from CRA to Vite**

To move an existing CRA project to Vite:

1. Install Vite:
   <CodeBlock
     className="my-24"
     compact
     codeInstances={[
       {
         code: "npm create vite@latest my-app --template react",
         label: "Vite",
         language: "sh",
       },
     ]}
     copyButton
   />
2. Move dependencies from `package.json` and adjust imports.
3. Replace Webpack-specific configurations with Viteâ€™s `vite.config.js`.

---

### **2. Next.js and Remix for SSR & SSG**

If your project requires server-side rendering, **Next.js** and **Remix** are better alternatives:

- **Next.js** provides file-based routing, API routes, and automatic image optimization.
- **Remix** focuses on traditional web standards and better data loading techniques.

These frameworks provide superior performance and developer experience compared to CRA.

## 4. Official Deprecation of Create-React-App

With the growing adoption of Vite, Next.js, and Remix, the React team officially **stopped recommending CRA** for new projects. The React documentation now suggests using **Vite for single-page applications (SPA)** and **Next.js for production-ready applications**.

---

## 5. Whatâ€™s Next? Alternatives to CRA

If youâ€™re starting a new React project, hereâ€™s what you should use instead:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Use Case</th>
    <th>Recommended Tool</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Small React apps (SPAs)</td>
    <td>**Vite**</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full-stack React apps</td>
    <td>**Next.js** or **Remix**</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Static sites</td>
    <td>**Astro** or **Next.js**</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For existing CRA projects, consider migrating to **Vite** for better performance and maintainability.

## Conclusion

The fall of **create-react-app** marks an important shift in the React ecosystem. While CRA played a crucial role in simplifying React development, its limitations, slow updates, and performance issues led to its decline. Today, **Vite, Next.js, and Remix** provide better alternatives, making React development faster and more efficient than ever before.

As developers, embracing these modern tools will not only improve performance but also enhance the overall development experience. If you're still using CRA, now is the time to migrate! ðŸš€
