When starting a new backend project, setting up authentication, API versioning, and best practices can take time. To simplify this, we created a **NestJS API Starter**, a ready-to-use template that includes **authentication, JWT refresh tokens, email verification, API documentation, and more**. This blog will walk you through how it works and how you can use it to jumpstart your next NestJS project.

## Why Use a NestJS Starter Template?

### 1. Saves Development Time

Instead of setting up authentication, middleware, and API structure from scratch, you can use this template and focus on building features.

### 2. Follows Best Practices

The template follows industry standards such as **JWT authentication, password hashing, error handling, and modular architecture**.

### 3. Built-in Security Features

It includes **refresh token support** and **email verification**, ensuring a secure foundation for your API.

### 4. Easily Scalable & Maintainable

The codebase is structured in a modular way, making it easy to **add new features**, **modify existing ones**, and **scale your application** as your project grows.

## Features of This NestJS API Starter

### âœ… Authentication & Security

- **JWT-based authentication** for secure user sessions
- **User registration & login** with password hashing
- **Email verification** using one-time tokens
- **Forgot password & reset password functionality**
- **Access & Refresh tokens for session management**

### âœ… API Structure & Documentation

- **RESTful API structure with versioning** to support future updates
- **Swagger UI for API documentation** to test and explore endpoints
- **Global error handling & logging** for consistent error responses

### âœ… Modular & Scalable Codebase

- **Separation of concerns with services, controllers, and DTOs**
- **Easily extendable architecture** for adding new features
- **Environment-based configuration** to manage different setups

## Getting Started with the Template

ðŸ“¦ Installation

npm Package: [nestjs-api-starter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nestjs-api-starter)

GitHub Repository: [techminion/nestjs-api-starter](https://github.com/techminion/nestjs-api-starter.git)

### **1. Create a New Project Using npx**

You can quickly scaffold a new project using `npx`:

<CodeBlock
  className="my-24"
  compact
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: "npx nestjs-api-starter my-app\ncd my-app\nnpm install",
      label: "create",
      language: "bash",
    },
  ]}
  copyButton
/>

This will create a new NestJS API project in the `my-app` directory.

### **2. Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory same as `.env.example`

### **3. Run the Application**

<CodeBlock
  className="my-24"
  compact
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: "npm run start:dev",
      label: "create",
      language: "bash",
    },
  ]}
  copyButton
/>

Your API will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

### **Auth Routes**

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>Endpoint</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`POST`</td>
    <td>`/auth/signup`</td>
    <td>Register a new user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`POST`</td>
    <td>`/auth/login`</td>
    <td>User login, returns JWT token</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`GET`</td>
    <td>`/auth/verify?token=...`</td>
    <td>Verify email address</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`POST`</td>
    <td>`/auth/forgot-password`</td>
    <td>Send password reset email</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`POST`</td>
    <td>`/auth/reset-password`</td>
    <td>Reset password using token</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`POST`</td>
    <td>`/auth/refresh-token`</td>
    <td>Get a new access token</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **User Routes**

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>Endpoint</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`GET`</td>
    <td>`/users/profile`</td>
    <td>Get authenticated user profile</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Using Swagger for API Documentation

This template comes with **Swagger UI** for easy API testing and documentation. You can access it at: http://localhost:3000/api/docs

## How JWT Refresh Tokens Work in This Template

Instead of requiring users to log in frequently, the refresh token mechanism allows them to request a new access token when the old one expires.

### **How it Works:**

1. **User logs in** and receives an **access token** (expires in 15 min) and a **refresh token** (expires in 7 days).
2. **When the access token expires**, the client sends a request to `/auth/refresh-token` with the refresh token.
3. **The server verifies the refresh token** and, if valid, issues a **new access and refresh token**.
4. **If the refresh token is invalid or expired**, the user must log in again.

### **Why Use Refresh Tokens?**

- **Enhanced Security:** Access tokens are short-lived to minimize exposure risk.
- **Better User Experience:** Users remain logged in without frequent re-authentication.
- **Prevents Overuse of Credentials:** Users don't need to send their passwords frequently.

## Extending the Template

This template provides a **strong foundation**, but you may want to extend it with additional features:

- **Social Authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.)**
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- **Rate Limiting & IP Blocking for Security**
- **GraphQL Support for API Flexibility**
- **Multi-Tenant Support for SaaS Applications**

## Conclusion

The **NestJS API Starter** is a powerful boilerplate that helps developers quickly set up a secure and scalable backend. With authentication, API versioning, and documentation already included, you can focus on building features instead of setting up the basics. Try it out today using:

<CodeBlock
  className="my-24"
  compact
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: "npx nestjs-api-starter my-app",
      label: "create",
      language: "bash",
    },
  ]}
  copyButton
/>
